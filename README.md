# Pokemon-Web-Scraping-Website
My first personal project
Scrapes tcgplayer.com for updated prices on Pokemon cards
Displays the data in a user friendly website

# Skills:
HTML, CSS, Python, Web Scraping

# Background:
This website takes data from an external Pokemon Price website that constantly updates due to supply and demand.  For my first project, I wanted a way to simply choose which Pokemon set I would like to view prices for an individual card for and search for the specific card in a search bar.  I also wanted to create this functionality in a form of a website.  The resulting project is a website that is styled using HTML and CSS and has functionalities that were created with Python and Web Scraping.

The Pokeball is clickable and returns to the home page.
Each set (Celebrations, Fusion Strike, and Evolving Skies) are clickable and will lead to their respective html pages.

The search bar takes user input and is expandable when the user's mouse hovers it.
