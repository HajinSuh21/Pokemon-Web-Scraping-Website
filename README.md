# Pokemon-Web-Scraping-Website
My first personal project
Scrapes tcgplayer.com for updated prices on Pokemon cards
Displays the data in a user friendly website

# Skills:
HTML, CSS, Python, Web Scraping

# Background:
This website takes data from an external Pokemon Price website that constantly updates due to supply and demand.  For my first project, I wanted a way to simply choose which Pokemon set I would like to view prices for an individual card for and search for the specific card in a search bar.  I also wanted to create this functionality in a form of a website.  The resulting project is a website that is styled using HTML and CSS and has functionalities that were created with Python and Web Scraping.
